## Welcome to my learning archives! ðŸ“–
In this repo, I just wanna share what I have learned recently (not all of my progress are about to share here, though. Just an application to simple case study).

## Learning 1: Learn Pandas
## Learning 2: Learn to make simple pipeline
**Objective**: This pipeline is meant to extract data from database and return as an excel file
**Process**:
1. You just need to create bank database (go check Alan Beauliau's on his "Learning SQL" book for full database syntax).
2. Installing Pandas, mysql.connector, and sqlalchemy to my local IDE
3. Connect Python to MySQL
**Output**
You can check the output on the ```sample_output.xlsx```
